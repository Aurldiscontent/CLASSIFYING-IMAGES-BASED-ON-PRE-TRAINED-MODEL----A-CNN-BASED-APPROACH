# Image Classification: Cat vs. Dog Classifier
This project focuses on building an image classification model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs using machine learning and deep learning techniques in Python. By leveraging a labeled dataset of cat and dog images, the model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful deep learning architecture for image recognition. The project includes essential steps such as data preprocessing, augmentation, feature extraction, and model tuning to enhance accuracy and generalization.

Using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, the classifier learns distinctive features of cats and dogs, improving its predictive capability over multiple iterations. The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project not only demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in image classification but also showcases real-world applications in areas like automated pet identification, security systems, and visual recognition technologies.
